      "Every summer we get thousands of AC service requests in Ghaziabad — and 8 out of 10 could have been prevented. Here are five signs your AC is asking for a service call.\n\n1.

Loud rattling — a loose fan blade or worn bearing.\n5. High electricity bills — the compressor is working overtime.\n\nA ₹499 service now is far cheaper than a ₹6,000 compressor later.",
